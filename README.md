# SMS Spam Classifier using NLP Neural Network  

This project is part of the **Machine Learning with Python Certification** offered by freeCodeCamp. The objective is to build an **NLP-based neural network** using TensorFlow and Keras to classify SMS messages as either **"ham"** (normal) or **"spam"** (unwanted messages).  

## Project Overview  

In this project, we:  
- Build a **neural network model for Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.  
- Preprocess text data to **clean and tokenize messages**.  
- Train the model on a **labeled dataset of SMS messages**.  
- Evaluate the model’s accuracy and performance on a test dataset.  

## Dataset  

The dataset used in this project is a collection of **SMS messages labeled as "ham" or "spam"**. The data has been split into the following sets:  

- `train/` — Contains SMS messages used for training the model.  
- `validation/` — Contains SMS messages used for validating the model’s performance during training.  
- `test/` — Contains SMS messages used for testing the model's final performance.  

The dataset was originally sourced from [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/), and you can access the full dataset via the course.  

## Requirements  

To run this project, you need the following dependencies installed:  

- Python 3.x  
- TensorFlow 2.x  
- Keras  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- TensorFlow Datasets (tfds)
